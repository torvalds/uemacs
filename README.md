## uEmacs/PK 4.0

Very old, very crusty, full screen editor based on MicroEMACS 3.9e.

Please don't use this, the whole thing only exists and is (badly)
maintained because I have been using this thing for decades, and my
fingers cannot be retrained from the strange keybindings this old
version of uemacs uses. 

Despite the name, the keybindings bear only passing resemblance to real
emacs, and the choices also tend to be incompatible with other editors
even when those editors keybindings are configurable.

This is a *bad* editor.  Really.  Unless you have used it since the
1980s, and have untrainable fingers, you should absolutely walk away and
never look back.  I've updated it minimally over the years to keep it
kind of working, but only kind of.

So this is a simplistic editor, written for an age when you had 64kB
limits and 300 or 1200 baud terminals were common.  It was not a better
age, and this is not a better editor.
